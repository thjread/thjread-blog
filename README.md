Source code for my blog at [https://blog.thjread.com/](https://blog.thjread.com).

The blog uses the [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) static site generator. A CircleCI pipeline automatically generates the output and pushes it to [https://github.com/thjread/thjread.github.io](https://github.com/thjread/thjread.github.io). The blog is then served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The styling takes inspiration from many places, but in particular the [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) website, [Noam Ross](https://www.noamross.net/)'s personal website and [Gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/).
