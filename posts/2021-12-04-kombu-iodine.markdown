## Overview

Kombu kelp has very high levels of iodine, and many Japanese recipes on the internet will contain much more iodine than is recommended by Western health agencies. The effects of too much iodine are poorly understood. If you're healthy it might not be a problem at all, but if you are pregnant, breast-feeding or have an underlying thyroid condition then it's a bad idea. Luckily you can remove most of the iodine from kombu by boiling it for 5 minutes or soaking it for at least 30 minutes, then discarding the water.

## What is kombu?

TODO photo of kombu, maybe my before-after one

Kombu is a kind of kelp seaweed, that grows in long, thick strips. Japanese cooking frequently uses kombu dashi, a stock made by soaking dried kelp in water. Dashi forms the base of miso soup as well as many soups, stews, sauces and more.

In 1908, Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda isolated glutamic acid as the compound responsible for the distinctive umami taste of kombu dashi, which lead to the commercial production of monosodium glutamate (MSG) as a food additive. These days many Japanese cooks use dashi powders rather than preparing their own; most powders have added MSG, and some don't even contain any kombu.

In the west, Kombu is becoming increasingly popular in vegetarian cooking, to provide umami together with a subtle complexity. It's often added to herbal supplements, largely as a natural rich source of iodine.

## Too much of a good thing?

Many seaweeds are good sources of iodine, but kombu and related seaweeds are the iodine champions. One gram of kombu (enough to make just 100ml of dashi) might contain 2000-4000 mcg of iodine. Compare this to the recommended daily allowance of just 140mcg -- that's a lot of iodine!

Is that too much? It's a little hard to say. The NHS recommends adults consume at most 500mcg of iodine per day, while the NIH lists the "tolerable upper intake" level at 1100mcg per day. Iodine is used for the production of key thyroid hormones. The thyroid regulates its uptake of iodine in order to produce an appropriate quantity of hormones regardless of the level of iodine in the diet (as long as it's above a certain minimum level). In a healthy person this system should allow them to consume large amount of iodine without obvious problems. In those with thyroid conditions or previous iodine deficiency, excessive iodine consumption can cause the system to break down, leading to either overproduction (hyperthyroidism) or underproduction (hypothyroidism) of thyroid hormones.

A complicating factor is that certain substances, called goitrogens, inhibit iodine uptake by the thyroid or inhibit production of thyroid hormones. Goitrogens (working by various different biochemical mechanisms) include tofu and other soy products; green tea; and cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, brocolli and pak choi. These are often part of a Japanese diet, and so consuming kombu as part of a goitrogen-rich Japanese diet might have less effect than consuming it as part of an otherwise Western diet.

An interesting case study is offered by Bonsoy brand soy milk in Australia in the late 2000s. At that time Bonsoy used significant amount of kombu to flavour their milk, until a cluster of patients with thyroid dysfunction caused by the milk led to a national recall and a class action lawsuit settled for $25m, divided among about 500 participants. From 2003 until the recall in 2009, Bonsoy soy milk contained around 30000mcg iodine per litre, about the same as kombu dashi. Participants in the lawsuit described a wide variety of issues, including severe hyperthyroidism in a woman who consumed three to four glasses of the milk per day, and hypothyroidism in the newborn baby of a woman who drank 500ml per day. These examples show that dashi should certainly be consumed in moderation, and should probably be avoided entirely by those who are pregnant, breast-feeding or have pre-existing thyroid conditions. It also suggests that the goitrogenic properties of soy products do not effectively prevent iodine toxicity.

So far I've been talking interchangeably about the quantity of iodine in kombu seaweed itself, and the quantity in the resulting dashi stock. Surprisingly this is a reasonable assumption - it doesn't take long to soak out almost all of the iodine in a piece of kombu. According to [a paper from 1989](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2744193/), 99% of the iodine ends up in the water if you boil kombu for 15 minutes, and 98% if you soak kombu at room temperature for 3 hours. This suggests a way to prepare dashi with less iodine. Simply boil or soak the kombu to remove the iodine, discard the water, then simmer or soak it again to make dashi. Traditional Japanese cooking already uses the idea of making dashi twice from the same piece of seaweed. The first, stronger dashi is called "ichiban dashi", and used for recipes where the dashi is a major ingredients, such as clear soups. The second dashi resulting from re-using the same seaweed is called "niban dashi", and is used for stews and sauces. So I was hopeful that I could come up with a procedure for removing most of the iodine from kombu, and still making a flavourful dashi. To do this, I first needed to run some experiments to confirm how much soaking or simmering it takes to remove enough iodine; then I needed to do some taste tests to find the technique which would have the least effect on flavour. The 1989 paper gave me some idea of what it would take to remove the iodine, but I was nervous that I might be misinterpreting it, since I could only read the abstract and the results table (the rest is written in Japanese!). So I wanted to double-check the results, as well as try some different timings.

## Can I measure iodine at home?

I started looking into ways I could measure iodine in food. I could send off a sample to a lab but it would cost several hundred pounds, a bit more than I could budget for idle curiosity. I'd have to do it myself. I needed a way to detect iodine at the concentrations I was expecting in dashi, about 30 mg per litre. That's a pretty small quantity, but not invisibly so: 30 mg is about half the mass of a grain of salt. If necessary I could boil down a large amount of dashi to concentrate the iodine.

From my school biology lessons, I remembered the starch-iodine test -- pour an iodine solution onto a cut piece of potato, and it'll stain all the starch granules deep blue-black. There we're using iodine to detect starch, but we can flip that on its head and use starch to detect iodine. I couldn't find a good source on how much iodine was necessary for the colour change, but it was clear that the reaction is very sensitive, so I was hopeful it would be able to pick up the low concentrations I'm interested in.

I tried putting a couple drops of dashi on some flour and ... nothing happened. The problem is that dashi doesn't contain iodine dissolved in elemental form. Iodine is very reactive and so rarely found on its own. Instead you're more likely to find iodine salts -- that is, the iodine is present as iodide ions. I couldn't find any information about iodine in seaweed specifically, but decided to work under the assumption that the iodine is mostly present in the form of iodide ions.

- TODO talk about iodate? https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/iodate
- TODO also iodooctane etc.

To use the starch-iodine test, we need to convert iodide into iodine. At this point I was reaching the limits of my rust chemistry knowledge, but luckily there's a famous experiment involving exactly the reaction we want, called the iodine clock reaction. You start with a solution of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, and add starch, sodium thiosulfate and potassium iodide. The hydrogen peroxide oxidises iodide to iodine, but the sodium thiosulfate converts the iodine back to iodide, acting too quickly for a significant concentration of iodine to build up. When the sodium thiosulfate runs out, the iodine is suddenly allowed to build up, and the solution dramatically turns a blue-black colour.

- chemical equation?

For our purposes we can ditch the sodium thiosulfate -- we just want to use the fact that a solution of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide will convert iodide to iodine. Hydrogen peroxide is easy to find, since it's used as a household cleaner, bleach and disinfectant. I decided to order a bottle of food-grade 3% hydrogen peroxide: the food-grade stuff has no additives that might interfere with the reaction, and 3% is sufficiently dilute that it's fairly safe. Sulfuric acid is harder to get hold of, but luckily any acid will do, such as acetic acid a.k.a. vinegar.

To make the experiment somewhat quantitative, I also bought some pure potassium iodide for comparison. This came as a small bag of white powder from "The Pharmer's Market", which must be one of the most suspicious looking things I've ever ordered off the internet...


## Experiment TODO better heading

After some initial tests to check the reaction really works, I dialed in a reproducible procedure: one drop starch solution (from 3g cornstarch boiled with 97g water), one drop distilled vinegar, one drop of 3% hydrogen peroxide, and five drops of the sample liquid to be tested, mixed together in a white plastic well. Iodine in the sample causes the mixture to turn anywhere from pale pink to deep blue-black, with the colour change stabilising after about 10 minutes.

<!-- Next I moved on to some experiments to see how much iodine is removed from kombu after boiling for different amounts of time. I cut six pieces of kombu, approximately 3 grams each, and recorded their exact weights. Five of the pieces went into a litre of boiling water, and I removed one at 15 seconds, 50 seconds, 2 minutes, 5 minutes and 15 minutes, while the remaining piece was left untreated. I discarded that water, then boiled each of the six pieces individually in 300ml of water for 10 minutes to extract (most of) the remaining iodine. I further boiled each kombu extract down to a consistent volume relative to the intial mass of kombu (52ml for a 3g piece). To make the experiment more quantitative, I prepared three solutions of different concentrations of potassium iodide. -->

Next I moved on to some experiments to see how much iodine is removed from kombu after boiling for different amounts of time. I cut six small pieces of kombu. I boiled five of the samples for different lengths of time between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, and left the remaining sample untouched. I then boiled each of the six pieces in fresh water for 10 minutes to extract the remaining iodine, and reduced the resulting liquid down to concentrate it (ending up with 17 ml of liquid for each gram kombu). I also prepared three solutions of known concentrations of potassium iodide.

Kombu dashi has a slightly yellow colour, so to help identify the colour change from the reaction I ran a series of control experiments where I just added drops of water instead of vinegar and hydrogen peroxide.

<!-- calculate concentration: base solution was 200mg KI in 500ml water = 400mg KI per litre. I has atomic weight 126.9, KI has atomic weight 39.1+126.9. So concentration of I is 400*126.9/(126.9+39.1) = 306mg / L so molarity is 400e-3 / (39.1+126.9) = 2.4e-3. Other samples are diluted by a factor of 10 and a factor of 100.-->

![Control samples from the first experiment, showing the yellow colour of the kombu extract.](/images/kombu_experiment_1_control.jpg){.image-medium .image-pad-vertical .center alt="Control samples from the first experiment"}

There was no visible colour change for the 2 minute or longer samples, or for the 3 mg/L solution. The 50 second sample had a slight colour change, and the 15 second sample was a little lighter than the 30 mg/L solution. The untreated kombu had the most remaining iodine, turning a deep black and looking most similar to the 300 mg/L solution.

The results fit my expectations: the samples were about six times more concentrated than dashi prepared in the usual way, so suggest that dashi contains roughly 300/6 = 50 mg/L iodine, close to our previous guess of 30 mg / L. They also confirmed my hopes that even a very brief period of soaking or boiling could remove a lot of the iodine.

Most kombu dashi recipes either suggest cold soaking or heating at a bare simmer, never boiling hard. I wanted to try some practical recipes with soaking or simmering, and I also wanted to more accurately figure out how much iodine was left. This time I made two samples -- one was simmered for 5 minutes, and the other was soaked for 30 minutes. I then soaked each sample in fresh water for overnight to extract remaining iodine, before reducing the samples until only a few drops remained -- just 1.6ml liquid per gram of kombu. I prepared three known concentration solutions of potassium iodide, around the range I was expecting the samples to be in.

![The top row shows the iodine remaining in a piece of kombu after simmering for 5 minutes or cold soaking for 30 minutes. The bottom row shows various known concentrations of iodine.](/images/kombu_experiment_2.png){.image-medium .image-pad-vertical .center alt="Results of the second experiment"}

![Control samples from the second experiment.](/images/kombu_experiment_2_control.jpg){.image-medium .image-pad-vertical .center alt="Control samples from the second experiment"}

Even after reducing the sample so much, there was no detectable iodine in the sample simmered for five minutes, while the soaked sample appeared similar to the 30 mg/L solution. Taking into account how much we reduced the samples, this suggests that dashi made using pre-simmered kombu in this way would have less than 0.3 mg/L iodine, and dashi made with pre-soaked kombu would have about 0.5 mg/L, in both cases well within safe limits!
