An algebraic theory...

- name drop operads, monads
- explain how will largely work from equational theory perspective
- say that post won't require significant knowledge of category theory

<!--more-->

## Equational theories

- rough def, examples of equational theories
- mention how this corresponds to "first order theory"

## Models of a theory

- models in Set
- models in other categories e.g. Top

## Choice of axiomatisation

- "clone"

## Other notions of theory

- explain how this isn't the only definition e.g. all variables appear once on each side, all variables appear once on each side in same order, more exotic variations?
TODO should this go earlier?

## Categorical approaches

- Lawvere theories, operads, Elts of a Thy, T-multicategories etc., monads
