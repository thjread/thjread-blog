## Writing up unfinished work

When given a very open ended research problem, often my instinct is to sit and think about it in my head, considering the story that might be told by a solution. I think thinking in your head is valuable -- it forces you to think at a high level, and not get bogged down in technical details. Perhaps this is why people often solve a problem on a walk or in the shower. Other times I think with rough paper, jotting down my thoughts, doing little calculations, trying to come up with appropriate notation or shorthand. Under ideal circumstances, paper can act as an extension of your working memory, and frees up your brain to notice connections and simplifications which you wouldn't have seen otherwise. Knowing what to write down and how best to write it is a skill that I would like to improve at.

These ways of thinking worked about as I'd expected. What took me by surprise was the value of slowing down and doing a proper (for me, LaTeXed) writeup, even of ideas which were unfinished or didn't quite work. Every time I did this I didn't expect to find anything new, and yet I always did. Sometimes I had previously skimmed over technical details or slight mismatches between different parts of the argument, but these would turn out to hint at something important about the problem, or even suggest new questions which might be more interesting than the original problem. Often parts of my work would be incredibly tedious to put into words, and finding notation and simplified arguments to explain these more compactly might make it easier to see how to go further, or generalise the ideas. In future I intend to consider doing careful writeups earlier, even though it might seem tedious.

## Making lists of questions

organise, source of todos when stuck, break up into chunks which can be surprisingly achievable



TODO rename file, change modified date

TODO alternative: lessons learned. 1 = writing stuff up, 2 = making TODOs as you go along, 3 = do calculations, 4 = iteratively rewrite stuff nicer and nicer (until it generalises?)
or thoughts: 1 = writing stuff up, 2 = making TODOs, 3 = reading literature vs doing things on your own, figuring out what's novel

I just finished an eight week summer research project in the maths department, whcih has been my first real taste of mathematical research. Even though I'm still very new to this, I feel like I've learnt a lot about how to approach research and think about hard mathematical problems, and I want to write those lessons down while I still remember them. I'd love to hear from those who have more experience about whether this resonates with you or not!

This post is going to focus on the level of rigour and detail you should use when thinking about an open-ended problem. I noticed that I had a tendency to do a lot of thinking in quite a loose manner, often without writing anything down, and focusing on the high-level paths and connections between parts of the problem. But when I scribbled some things down on paper I tended to notice different aspects of the problem. And when I took the time to do a proper rigorous writeup of some of my thoughts I almost always found new ideas and new ways of looking at the problem, even when I expected the writeup to be boring and straightforward. So in future I plan to consciously make sure I use a good balance of these different ways of thinking, not leaning on any particular one too much. Below, I describe these ways of thinking in more detail, and my thoughts on their strengths and weaknesses.

Note that this post is talking about the earlier stages of research, when you're not quite sure if your ideas are correct or what approach to take. Obviously once a piece of work is finished and you want to turn it into a paper, you should write it up with an appropriate level of rigour -- I'm interested in writing bits up at an earlier stage before you know if they're going to be useful or not.
    
TODO use "writing up" less?

## Thinking with paper

If I ask you to imagine a mathematician working, you probably picture a person sitting at a desk, scribbling on a sheet of paper (or otherwise standing at a blackboard).
thinking with paper (expanded working memory, chunking, notice similarities + simplifications, maryam mirzhakani photo) vs
default if you imagine a mathematician

## Loose, in-your-head thinking

thinking in head (story of where you're coming from and where you're trying to go, shower effect, connections) vs

## "Writing up"

I think a lot of people tend to think of "writing up" as a boring chore. But...

writing up (find mistakes, notice technical details/mismatches which might be an important clue or lead to interesting questions, find better notation / explanations which will help with other levels of rigour, useful record for others / future self
