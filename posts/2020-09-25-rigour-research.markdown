TODO rename file, change modified date

I just finished an eight week summer research project in the maths department, whcih has been my first real taste of mathematical research. Even though I'm still very new to this, I feel like I've learnt a lot about how to approach research and think about hard mathematical problems, and I want to write those lessons down while I still remember them. I'd love to hear from those who have more experience about whether this resonates with you or not!

This post is going to focus on the level of rigour and detail you should use when thinking about an open-ended problem. I noticed that I had a tendency to do a lot of thinking in quite a loose manner, often without writing anything down, and focusing on the high-level paths and connections between parts of the problem. But when I scribbled some things down on paper I tended to notice different aspects of the problem. And when I took the time to do a proper rigorous writeup of some of my thoughts I almost always found new ideas and new ways of looking at the problem, even when I expected the writeup to be boring and straightforward. So in future I plan to consciously make sure I use a good balance of these different ways of thinking, not leaning on any particular one too much. Below, I describe these ways of thinking in more detail, and my thoughts on their strengths and weaknesses.

Note that this post is talking about the earlier stages of research, when you're not quite sure if your ideas are correct or what approach to take. Obviously once a piece of work is finished and you want to turn it into a paper, you should write it up with an appropriate level of rigour -- I'm interested in writing bits up at an earlier stage before you know if they're going to be useful or not.
    
TODO use "writing up" less?

## Loose, in-your-head thinking

thinking in head (story of where you're coming from and where you're trying to go, shower effect, connections) vs

## Thinking with paper

thinking with paper (expanded working memory, chunking, notice similarities + simplifications, maryam mirzhakani photo) vs

## "Writing up"

I think a lot of people tend to think of "writing up" as a boring chore. But...

writing up (find mistakes, notice technical details/mismatches which might be an important clue or lead to interesting questions, find better notation / explanations which will help with other levels of rigour, useful record for others / future self
